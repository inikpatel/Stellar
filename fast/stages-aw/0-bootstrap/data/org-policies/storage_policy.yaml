# Secure your Cloud Storage data from public exposure by enforcing public access
# prevention. This governance policy prevents existing and future resources from
# being accessed via the public internet by disabling and blocking ACLs and IAM
# permissions that grant access to allUsers and allAuthenticatedUsers. Enforce
# this policy on the entire organization (recommended), specific projects, or
# specific folders to ensure no data is publicly exposed.This policy overrides
# existing public permissions. Public access will be revoked for existing buckets
# and objects after this policy is enabled.

# The constraint defines the set of authentication types that would be restricted
# from accessing any storage resources under the organization in Cloud Storage.
# Supported values are USER_ACCOUNT_HMAC_SIGNED_REQUESTS and
# SERVICE_ACCOUNT_HMAC_SIGNED_REQUESTS. Use in:ALL_HMAC_SIGNED_REQUESTS
# to include both.

# This list constraint defines the set of durations for retention policies that
# can be set on Cloud Storage buckets. By default, if no organization policy is
# specified, a Cloud Storage bucket can have a retention policy of any duration.
# The list of allowed durations must be specified as a positive integer value
# greater than zero, representing the retention policy in seconds. Any insert,
# update, or patch operation on a bucket in the organization resource must have
# a retention policy duration that matches the constraint. Enforcement of this
# constraint is not retroactive. When a new organization policy is applied, the
# retention policy of existing buckets remains unchanged and valid.

# This boolean constraint requires buckets to use uniform bucket-level access
# where this constraint is set to True. Any new bucket in the Organization
# resource must have uniform bucket-level access enabled, and no existing
# buckets in the organization resource can disable uniform bucket-level access.
# Enforcement of this constraint is not retroactive: existing buckets with
# uniform bucket-level access disabled continue to have it disabled. The default
# value for this constraint is False. Uniform bucket-level access disables the
# evaluation of ACLs assigned to Cloud Storage objects in the bucket.
# Consequently, only IAM policies grant access to objects in these buckets.
