# This list constraint defines the set of Private Service Connect endpoint types
# for which users cannot create forwarding rules. When this constraint is
# enforced, users will be blocked from creating forwarding rules for the Private
# Service Connect endpoint type. This constraint is not retroactively enforced.
# By default, forwarding rules can be created for any Private Service Connect
# endpoint type. The allowed/denied list of Private Service Connect endpoints
# must come from the list below:
#  [GOOGLE_APIS, SERVICE_PRODUCERS].
# Using GOOGLE_APIS in the allowed/denied list will restrict the creation of
# Private Service Connect forwarding rules for accessing Google APIs. Using
# SERVICE_PRODUCERS in the allowed/denied list will restrict the creation of
# Private Service Connect forwarding rules for accessing services in another
# VPC network.
