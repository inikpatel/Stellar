# When Detailed Audit Logging Mode is enforced, both the request and response
# are included in Cloud Audit Logs. Changes to this feature may take up to 10
# minutes to reflect. This Org Policy is highly encouraged in coordination with
# Bucket Lock when seeking compliances such as SEC Rule 17a-4(f),
# CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d), and FINRA Rule 4511(c). This policy is currently only
# supported in Cloud Storage.

# This list constraint defines the set of locations where location-based Google
# Cloud resources can be created. By default, resources can be created in any
# location. Policies for this constraint can specify multi-regions such as asia
# and europe, regions such as us-east1 or europe-west1 as allowed or denied
# locations. Allowing or denying a multi-region does not imply that all included
# sub-locations should also be allowed or denied. For example, if the policy
# denies the us multi-region (which refers to multi-region resources, like some
# storage services), resources can still be created in the regional location
# us-east1. On the other hand, the in:us-locations group contains all locations
# within the us region, and can be used to block every region. We recommend
# using value groups to define your policy. You can specify value groups,
# collections of locations that are curated by Google to provide a simple way
# to define your resource locations. To use value groups in your organization
# policy, prefix your entries with the string in:, followed by the value group.
# For example, to create resources that will only be physically located within
# the US, set in:us-locations in the list of allowed values.If the
# suggested_value field is used in a location policy, it should be a region.
# If the value specified is a region, a UI for a zonal resource may pre-populate
# any zone in that region.

# This constraint defines the set of Google Cloud resource services that can be
# used within an organization, folder, or project, such as compute.googleapis.com
# and storage.googleapis.com. By default, all Google Cloud resource services are
# allowed. For more information, see
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/help/organization-policy/restricting-resources.

# This list constraint acts as a check to verify that a project with a service
# enabled is eligible for cross-organization move. A resource with a supported
# service enabled must have this constraint enforced and that supported service
# included in the allowed values to be eligible for a cross-organization move.
# The current list of allowed values for supported services that can be used is:
# [SHARED_VPC]. This constraint provides an additional control on top of
# constraints/resourcemanager.allowedExportDestinations.
# This list_constraint is empty by default and will not block cross organization
# moves unless a supported service is enabled on the resource to be exported.
# This constraint allows more fine-grained control over resources using features
# that require more caution when being moved to another organization. By default,
# a resource with a supported service enabled cannot be moved across organizations.
# SHOULD HAVE
# resourcemanager.allowEnabledServicesForExport:

# This boolean constraint, when enforced, allows organization policy administrators
# to ensure that only contacts assigned at the organization or folder level can
# receive security notifications. Specifically, enforcing this constraint blocks
# project owners and contact administrators from creating or updating an Essential
# Contact with a notification_category_subscriptions field that contains either
# the SECURITY or ALL category, if the contact also has a project resource as a parent.

# This list constraint defines the set of Private Service Connect endpoint types
# for which users cannot create forwarding rules. When this constraint is
# enforced, users will be blocked from creating forwarding rules for the Private
# Service Connect endpoint type. This constraint is not retroactively enforced.
# By default, forwarding rules can be created for any Private Service Connect
# endpoint type. The allowed/denied list of Private Service Connect endpoints must
# come from the list below: [GOOGLE_APIS, SERVICE_PRODUCERS]. Using GOOGLE_APIS
# in the allowed/denied list will restrict the creation of Private Service Connect
# forwarding rules for accessing Google APIs. Using SERVICE_PRODUCERS in the
# allowed/denied list will restrict the creation of Private Service Connect forwarding
# rules for accessing services in another VPC network.
