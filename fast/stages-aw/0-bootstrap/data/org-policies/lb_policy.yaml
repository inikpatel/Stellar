# This list constraint defines the set of load balancer types which can be

# to be allowed or denied must be listed explicitly. By default, creation of
# all types of load balancers is allowed. The list of allowed or denied values
# must be identified as the string name of a load balancer, and can only
# include values from the list below:
#   [ INTERNAL_TCP_UDP, INTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS, EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP,
#     EXTERNAL_TCP_PROXY, EXTERNAL_SSL_PROXY, EXTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS,

#     REGIONAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY,
#     GLOBAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS].

# in: prefix followed by INTERNAL or EXTERNAL. For example, allowing
# in:INTERNAL will allow all load balancer types from the above list that
