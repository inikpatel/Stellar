# This list constraint defines the set of service accounts that can be granted OAuth 2.0 access tokens with a lifetime of up to 12 hours. By default, the maximum lifetime for these access tokens is 1 hour. The allowed/denied list of service accounts must specify one or more service account email addresses.

# This boolean constraint, when enforced, prevents the default App Engine and
# Compute Engine service accounts that are created in your projects from being
# automatically granted any IAM role on the project when the accounts are
# created. By default, these service accounts automatically receive the Editor
# role when they are created.

# This boolean constraint, when ENFORCED, prevents users from removing a

# This list constraint defines the maximum duration allowed for service account
# key expiry. By default, created keys never expire. The allowed duration is
# specified in hours, and must come from the list below. Only one allowed value
# can be specified, and denied values are not supported. Specifying a duration
# not in this list will result in an error. [1h, 8h, 24h, 168h, 336h, 720h,
# 1440h, 2160h]. To enforce this constraint, you must set it to replace the
# parent policy in the Cloud Console, or set inheritFromParent=false in the
# policy file if using the gcloud CLI. This constraint can't be merged with a
# parent policy. Enforcement of the constraint is not retroactive and will not
# change pre-existing keys.
