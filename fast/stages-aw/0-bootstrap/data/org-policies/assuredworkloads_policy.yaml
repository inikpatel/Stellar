# PREVIEW: This constraint defines the set of TLS versions that cannot be used on
# the organization, folder, or project where this constraint is enforced, or any
# of that resource's children in the resource hierarchy. By default, all TLS
# versions are allowed. TLS versions can only be specified in the denied list,
# and must be identified in the form TLS_VERSION_1 or TLS_VERSION_1_1.This
# constraint is only applied to requests using TLS. It will not be used to
# restrict unencrpyted requests. For more information, see
# https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/restrict-tls-versions.
