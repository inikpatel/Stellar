# This list constraint defines the Cloud KMS key types which may be created
# under a given hierarchy node. When this constraint is enforced, only KMS
# key types specified within this org policy may be created within the
# associated hierarchy node. Configuring this org policy will also impact the
# protection level of import jobs and key versions. By default, all key types
# are allowed. Valid values are: SOFTWARE, HSM, EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_VPC. Deny
# policies are disallowed.

# This list constraint defines which projects may be used to supply
# Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) when creating resources. Setting this
# constraint to Allow (i.e. only allow CMEK keys from these projects) ensures
# that CMEK keys from other projects cannot be used to protect newly created
# resources. Values for this constraint must be specified in the form of
#   under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID,
#   under:folders/FOLDER_ID,
#   or projects/PROJECT_ID.
# Supported services that enforce this constraint are:
# [aiplatform.googleapis.com, artifactregistry.googleapis.com,
# bigquery.googleapis.com, bigtable.googleapis.com, composer.googleapis.com,
# compute.googleapis.com, container.googleapis.com, dataflow.googleapis.com,
# dataproc.googleapis.com, documentai.googleapis.com, logging.googleapis.com,
# pubsub.googleapis.com, run.googleapis.com, secretmanager.googleapis.com,
# spanner.googleapis.com, sqladmin.googleapis.com, storage.googleapis.com].
#
# Enforcement of this constraint may grow over time to include additional
# services.
# Use caution when applying this constraint to projects, folders, or
# organizations where a mix of supported and unsupported services are used.
# Setting this constraint to Deny or Deny All is not permitted. Enforcement
# of this constraint is not retroactive. Existing CMEK Google Cloud resources
# with KMS CryptoKeys from disallowed projects must be reconfigured or
# recreated manually to ensure enforcement.

# This list constraint defines which services require Customer-Managed
# Encryption Keys (CMEK). Setting this constraint to Deny (i.e. deny resource
# creation without CMEK) requires that, for the specified services, newly
# created resources must be protected by a CMEK key. Supported services that
# can be set in this constraint are:
# [aiplatform.googleapis.com, artifactregistry.googleapis.com,
# bigquery.googleapis.com, bigtable.googleapis.com, composer.googleapis.com,

# Setting this constraint to Deny All is not permitted. Setting this constraint
# to Allow is not permitted.
# Enforcement of this constraint is not retroactive. Existing non-CMEK Google
# Cloud resources must be reconfigured or recreated manually to ensure enforcement.
