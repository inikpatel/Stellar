# This list constraint defines the allowed Cloud Build integrations
# for performing Builds through receiving webhooks from services outside
# Google Cloud. When this constraint is enforced, only webhooks for
# services whose host matches one of the allowed values will be processed.
# By default, Cloud Build processes all webhooks for projects that have at
# least one LIVE trigger.
# COULD HAVE
# Recommendation: 
# - allow all if there's no restrictions, otherwise add domain names
# acording to the event, for example:
#   - RepoSync event: source.developers.google.com
#   - GitHub app event: github.com
#   - GitHub Enterprise event: ghe-staging-test.com 
#   - Pub/Sub event: derived from the source specified in the trigger.
#   - Webhook event: derived from the source specified in the trigger.

# This list constraint defines the set of allowed Cloud Build Worker Pools
# for performing Builds using Cloud Build. When this constraint is enforced,
# builds will be required to build in a Worker Pool that matches one of the
# allowed values. By default, Cloud Build can use any Worker Pool. The allowed
# list of Worker Pools must be of the form:
# [ under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID,
#   under:folders/FOLDER_ID ,
#   under:projects/PROJECT_ID ,
#   projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/workerPools/WORKER_POOL_ID
# ].
