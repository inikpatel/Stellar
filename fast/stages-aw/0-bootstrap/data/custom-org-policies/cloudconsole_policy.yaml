# This list constraint, when enforced on an organization resource, defines
# the set of Google Cloud resources that are returned in list and search
# methods for users in the domain of the organization where this constraint
# is enforced. This can be used to limit what resources are visible in various
# parts of the Cloud Console, such as the Resource Picker, Search, and Manage
# Resources page. Note that this Constraint is only ever evaluated at the
# Organization level. Values specified in allow/deny lists must be in the
# form: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID.
