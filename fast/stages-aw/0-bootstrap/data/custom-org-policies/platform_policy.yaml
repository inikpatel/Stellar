# allowed by this constraint. Moves within an Organization are not governed by this
# constraint. The move operation will still require the same IAM permissions as normal
# resource moves. Values specified in allow/deny lists must be in the form:

# This list constraint defines one or more Cloud Identity or Google Workspace
# customer IDs whose principals can be added to IAM policies. By default, all
# user identities are allowed to be added to IAM policies. Only allowed values
# can be defined in this constraint, denied values are not supported. If this
# constraint is active, only principals that belong to the allowed customer IDs
# can be added to IAM policies.
# MUST HAVE
# Recommendation:
#   This policy is strongly advised. Enforce at the organisation level but be
# cautious of potential issues. When this policy is enforced, even if the user
# has setIamPolicy on the APIs of Google Cloud services, they won't be allowed
# to add users of non-authorized domains. This also blocks the exposure of
# data; for example, a user won't be able to set permission to allUsers or
# authentificatedUsers in Cloud Storage to make the buckets public.
#  use `gcloud organizations list` to query the domain id and/or directory
# customer id.
