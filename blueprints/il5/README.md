# Google Cloud service Blueprint projects
The directory provide multiple Google Cloud Services that contains all the necessary Terraform modules to build and deploy a GCP service in an IL5 (Impact Level 5) Assured workload enviornment.
- Enable Necessary APIs: Depending on the services your project will use (e.g., Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL), enable the corresponding APIs in the Google Cloud Console.
- When implementing IL5 Assured workloads in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), several stringent security controls and measures must be in place to meet the requirements. The GCP Services in the Blueprint project are designed to meet the requirements for  IL5 (Impact Level 5) Assured workload enviornment.
- The GCP Services are designed and configurations that align with IL5 security standards.

# Assured Workload
-  In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), an [Assured Workload](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/assured-workloads?hl=en) is a specific designation and offering designed to help customers meet regulatory and compliance requirements for handling sensitive data and workloads.
- Assured Workloads in Google Cloud Platform offer a structured approach for organizations to deploy and manage sensitive and regulated workloads while meeting industry-specific compliance requirements.
- By leveraging GCP's security capabilities and compliance frameworks, customers can enhance data protection, ensure regulatory compliance, and focus on their core business activities with confidence.
- Assured Workloads provide a framework within GCP that adheres to specific security and compliance standards, ensuring that customers can confidently deploy and manage their workloads while meeting the IL standarads.

## IL5 (Impact Level 5) Environment

- IL5 (Impact Level 5) Environment in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) refers to a specific security compliance standard defined by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). IL5 mandates stringent security controls to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that is sensitive but unclassified.
- Assured Workloads and IL5 environments in Google Cloud Platform provide tailored solutions for organizations requiring robust security and compliance measures.
